    it only carries the identity data needed to run a recruitment process.
    A Person is looked up/created (see services/recruitment_service.py
    hire()) only once an Application actually gets hired.

    Reuses BaseModel (entity+branch required) like every other hr model
    instead of a looser tenant story: a candidate belongs to the Entity
    they first applied to, which gives the tenant-isolation guarantee
    (Entity A cannot see/hire Entity B's candidates) for free via the
    same get_queryset() filtering every other model already relies on.
    A candidate applying to more than one Entity is out of scope for this
    phase - each Entity would need its own Candidate row.

    resume is a plain FileField, not the generic Document model
    (engine/models/document.py): Document models an identity document
    with a required, unique-per-type `numero` (ID card, certificate) -
    forcing every CV upload to also carry a synthetic document number
    would be a worse fit than Django's own FileField, which Document
    itself is built on anyway.
