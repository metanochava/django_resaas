Atomic Person(+reuse)/Document/PersonContact/Employee creation for the
add_employee flow (EmployeeSEPage.vue).

A single DB transaction, so a failure partway through never leaves a
Person/Document/PersonContact created without the Employee record the
whole operation was actually for (CLAUDE.md: "Se falhar a criação do
Employee, não devemos terminar inadvertidamente com dados parcialmente
criados"). Person duplicate-detection itself lives in the reusable
saas.core.services.person_matching_service - this only executes
whatever choice the caller already made (reuse an existing Person, or
create a new one).

    person_id: an existing Person id chosen from person_matching_service's
        candidates - skips Person creation entirely. Mutually exclusive
        with person_data.
    person_data: PersonSerializer-shaped dict for a genuinely new Person
        (the caller confirmed "create new person anyway", or no
        candidates were found at all).
    photo: an uploaded File for a NEW person's photo, or None - applied
        as its own save() so PersonSerializer.create() never needs to
        special-case a File among otherwise-plain fields.
    documents: [{"tipo", "numero", "data_emissao", "data_validade",
        "arquivo": File|None}, ...] - only documents to actually
        CREATE. A candidate's own pre-existing documents are never
        resent here (the frontend already has them from the match
        response), so this never checks for "already has this
        document" - a genuine duplicate (tipo, numero) still hits
        Document's own unique_together and surfaces as a normal
        validation error either way.
    contacts: [{...PersonContact fields...}, ...] - only NEW contacts,
        same reasoning as documents.
