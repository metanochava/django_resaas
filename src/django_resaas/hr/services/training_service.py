"""Fase 7 (Training): enrollment/completion workflow + a ready-to-use
certification expiry lookup.

Same service+exception shape as attendance_service.py (Fase 2)/
leave_service.py (Fase 3)/recruitment_service.py (Fase 4)/
onboarding_service.py (Fase 5)/performance_service.py (Fase 6): pure

transaction.atomic() left to the caller (the view actions),
EventDispatcher.emit() for every meaningful transition - never imports
notifications directly (pedido secção 56/57).
